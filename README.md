# Xayn Discovery Engine

Here you can find our Personalised Semantic Search and Recommendations service implementation.

To test our fully managed Personalised Semantic Search and Recommendations Plug-in, you can get started by requesting a test environment [here](https://www.xayn.com/developers#B2b-form) and having a look at our API documentation: 

The Front Office API provides the API that is needed to get personalised content or do semantic searches. It is also used to transmit a user's interactions for personalisation. You can find its reference here: [Front Office API](https://xaynetwork.github.io/xayn_discovery_engine/front_office.html)

The back office allows you to define which pieces of your content shall be personalised for your users. You use the back office to add/remove your content pieces, which we refer to as “documents”. You can find its reference here: [Back Office API](https://xaynetwork.github.io/xayn_discovery_engine/back_office.html)
