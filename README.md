# Xayn Discovery Engine

Here you can find our Personalised Semantic Search and Recommendations service implementation.

The Front Office API provides the API that is needed to get personalised content or do semantic searches. It is also used to transmit a user's interactions for personalisation. You can find its reference here: [Front Office API](https://xaynetwork.github.io/xayn_discovery_engine/front_office.html)

The back office allows you to define which pieces of your content shall be personalised for your users. You use the back office to add/remove your content pieces, which we refer to as “documents”. You can find its reference here: [Back Office API](https://xaynetwork.github.io/xayn_discovery_engine/back_office.html)
