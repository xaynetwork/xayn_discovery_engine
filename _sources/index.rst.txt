Xayn Api 
========




The API allows you to integrate Xayn's Personalised Semantic Search and Recommendations service into your systems. 
It is divided into two parts: the back office and the front office. The back office manages everything related to documents. 
The front office interacts with the service to manage the users' interactions with the documents, requests personalized documents, or performs searches.
