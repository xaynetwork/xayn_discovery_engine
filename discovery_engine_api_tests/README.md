### Test execution and reporting üì±
1. `cd tests`

 - `pytest --allure-severities normal,critical` - execute test with only **normal** and **critical** severity
 - `pytest -k TestInteractionsEndpoint` - execute all tests in **TestInteractionsEndpoint** class
 - `allure serve $(pwd)/reports` - generate Allure report

### General rules  üìù

 - All test class as well as test methods names should start with `test_`
 - All tests should be marked with label `@allure.severity(allure.severity_level)`
 - All test that contain multiple checks should use soft assertions from assert_utils
 - All reusable setup/teardown methods must be decorated with `@pytest.fixture` (see examples inside tests)
 - All tests that require refactoring or expected to skip should be marked with label `@pytest.mark.skip("reason for skipping")`
 - All tests that expected to fail due some bug or improvement should be marked with label `@pytest.mark.xfail("reason for failing")`
