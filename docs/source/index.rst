Xayn Api 
========

The API allows you to integrate Xayn's Personalised Semantic Search and Recommendations service into your systems. 

The API is divided into two parts: the back office and the front office. The back office allows you to manage everything related to your content. In the Xayn service, every piece of content is managed as *document*'s. 
The front office allows you to interact with the service to manage the users' interactions (clicks, reading, viewing) with your content, request recommendations, or perform searches.
