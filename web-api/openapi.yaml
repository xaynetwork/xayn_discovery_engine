    # Overview
    The personalization system is divided into two parts: one to manage documents and one to manage users.

    ## Documents management
    For this system, a document is anything that has an id, a snippet, and an arbitrary set of properties.
    The id uniquely identifies the document in the system.
    The system uses the snippet to create a document representation that can be matched against user interests.

    It is possible to attach any properties to a document; the system will not use them but will be returned together with the document when asking for personalized documents for a user. They could help store information like a title and the URL where it is possible to find the document. Each document can have its own set of properties.

    The API offers an endpoint that allows uploading the documents to the system. After a successful upload, it will be possible to use the document in other endpoints.

    ## User management
    The system identifies a user with only an id.
    There are two main endpoints: one that allows registering an interaction between a user and a document (a user clicked or liked a document), and one to retrieve a personalized set of documents for the user. The system needs a few user interactions with documents before it can generate a personalized list.

    # Auth
    To authenticate with the API two bearer tokens will be provided. One will work for the
    user endpoints and the other one to manage the documents.

        Returns a list of documents personalized for the given `user_id`.
        Each document contains the id, the score and the properties that are attached to the document.
        The score is a value between 0 and 1 where a higher value means that the document matches the preferences of the user better.
