    # Front Office
    The front office is typically used within front-end apps, for example a website or a mobile application.
    With this API, you can handle interactions with documents and search for personalized documents.

    ## Format
    All the request bodies in this API are JSON encoded and their `content-type` header should be set to `application/json`.

    ## Auth
    The API requires to set the `authorizationToken` header when used with the provided token.

    ## User
    Most methods require a `user_id`.
    From our perspective, a `user_id` is simply required to group interactions together. We don't need to know who that user is, so it is preferred to create this `user_id` in a privacy-preserving way.
    For example, create a hash method which transforms your user into an ID hash.

    ## Document
    A document here is represented by its `id` and optional `properties`.
    In order to display a document in an interface, it's preferred to use `properties`, which is an arbitrary collection of values.
    For example, it could contain an image url, a full article url, the publication date, the author or much more.
    The properties that were added when the document was submitted to us, are just mirrored here.

      description: |-
        Get a list of snippets personalized for the given `user_id`.

        Each snippet has an id and contains the id of the document it originates from as well as a score. A higher score means that the document matches the preferences of the user better.
        Scores can be compared only with other scores that belong to the same request; comparing scores of documents that have been obtained through different requests can lead to unexpected results.

        The snippet also contain the parent documents properties if this is requested and the properties are not empty.
        Documents that have been interacted with by the user are filtered out from the result.
        Note that you can request personalized documents for a specific `user_id`, only after that same `user_id` has made enough interactions via our system.

      summary: Semantic search in documents
      description: |-
        Semantically search through the documents in different ways.

        When a snippet id is used, the system will return snippets across all documents, that are similar
        to the one referred to by the given id.

        When a document id is used it will _currently_ search as if you had provided the snippet id of an
        arbitrary snippet in the document. This means it's for now only meaningful usable with documents which
        only have one snippet. That will likely change in the future.

        When a `query` is provided, the system will return documents that are similar to the query.
        If `enable_hybrid_search` is passed, then the system will also perform keyword matching between the query and the documents.
        It is possible to personalize the result by passing a user id or history. In this case, the system will consider the user's interests to rank the documents.
        Each document contains the `id` and the `score`, where a higher value means that the document is more similar to the input. Scores can be compared only with other scores that belong to the same request; comparing scores of documents that have been obtained through different requests can lead to unexpected results.
        The documents also contain their `properties` if this is requested and the properties are not empty.
