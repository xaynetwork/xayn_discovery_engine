History:

  description: |-
    The history is an sequence of entries representing
    documents visited by the user.

    It is ordered from the  "oldest" interaction at index 0 to the "newest" interaction
    at the highest index.

    History entries do not need to have a timestamp, if no timestamp is given it is
    approximated in some way based on timestamps of neighboring documents and if non
    have a timestamp they are all assumed to have happened "just now" for simplicity.
