    - can be in the future
    - will be converted to and then stored as UTC
    - sub-second resolution is not guaranteed.
    - while `properties.publication_date` is in the future the document will not be
      returned for personalized documents, once it is no longer in the future it will
      automatically be considered for personalization from then on
